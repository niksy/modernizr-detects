# Modernizr feature detects

Set of [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) feature detects which for whatever
reason won’t or shouldn’t go to the main library repository.

## Installation

```sh
npm install modernizr-detects --save-dev
```

## Usage

Use it as part of `customTests` feature of [Customizr](https://github.com/doctyper/customizr).

Since that project is currently unmaintained, I’m maintaining [fork](https://github.com/niksy/customizr) which is 
updated to work with new Modernizr features.
